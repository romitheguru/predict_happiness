Machine learning model to predict customer sentiment
Built a predictive model using natural language processing and machine learning to predict the customer sentiment.
Analysed the customers' hotel reviews data set to classify a review into happy/unhappy category.

I used xgboost to build a model and got 89% accuracy.
